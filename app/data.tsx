At least once a year, tribes from all around the Arabian Peninsula, would converge on Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. They would circle the shrine seven times, kiss the Black Stone embedded in the wall of Ka'abah. Hajj has been a great source of revenue for Mecca and for its custodian.",

In the southwest, the Western Wall stands as a remnant of the Second Temple, representing the holiest site in Judaism. While the Israeli government maintains political sovereignty over the compound, the custodianship of the religious sites is entrusted to an Islamic Council known as the Waqf. <div class='mt-3'></div>According to the Bible, King Solomon built the First Temple on this site. In a 1929 publication titled &quot;A Brief Guide to the Haram al-Sharif,&quot; written by Waqf historian Aref al Aref, it is declared that the Mount's &quot;identity with the site of Solomon’s temple is beyond dispute.&quot; This fact was contested by Yasser Arafat during his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000.",

However, when the Jewish community did not embrace Lutheranism, he turned vehemently against them. In a pivotal turn, Luther published a pamphlet titled "On the Jews and Their Lies," considered one of the earliest works of modern anti-Semitism.

			"Reverend William H. Hechler (1845–1931) was an Anglican clergyman and a notable Christian Zionist. He is perhaps best known for his association with Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern political Zionism.<div class='mt-3'></div>Hechler and Herzl first met in 1896, and Hechler quickly became a supporter of Herzl's Zionist vision. Hechler believed in the idea of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy and, as a Christian Zionist, he saw it as an essential step toward the realization of Christian eschatology.<div class='mt-3'></div>Hechler used his connections in European aristocratic and political circles to assist Herzl in gaining support for the Zionist cause. He introduced Herzl to various influential figures, including German Emperor Wilhelm II, as well as other European leaders. It's worth noting that Herzl's initial efforts to gain political support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland faced challenges, but Hechler's assistance helped open doors to some influential individuals.
