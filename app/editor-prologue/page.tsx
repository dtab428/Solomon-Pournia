				In 1917 Great Britain issued the Balfour Declaration supporting the
				establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The League of Nations
				confirmed a British mandate for Palestine after World War I – based on
				the British promise– to establish a ‘Jewish homeland’. In 1920 the first
				riots against Jewish immigration broke out in Jaffa in Palestine. Some
				decades later as Nazi power grew in Germany, Jewish immigration to
				Palestine increased, the Arabs of Palestine protested and began a revolt
				against British control. The British first proposed the Peel Plan
				(1937), which would have created a very small Jewish state and a much
				larger Arab state. The Jews accepted, but the Arabs refused. Shortly
				after the British issued the White Paper of 1939, which limited Jewish
				immigration to Palestine.

				Nevertheless, in 1947, after the Holocaust and murder of 6,000,000 Jews,
				a new wave of Jewish migration to Palestine started, and thus conflict
				between the Jews and Palestinian Arabs increased. In 1947 United Nations
				approved a new partition plan to divide Palestine into a Jewish and an
				Arab state. In this plan, Jerusalem was announced as an
				internationalized city. Again, the Jews accepted the plan, but the Arabs
				did not. As a result, a civil war between the Jews and Arabs of
				Palestine ensued and in reality, the mentioned plan could not be
				implemented. However, during this time, the Jews gained control of most
				of the territory ceded to them by the United Nations. The first wave of
				Palestinian refugees was the direct consequence of this conflict. A
				Middle Eastern dilemma which less than two decades later instigated the
				Six-Day-War in June 1967 followed by various Palestinian movements and
				riots; events and conflicts, whose backgrounds have been meticulously
				explained by the author of the present book.

				De facto the broad term of ‘Arabo-Jewish conflict’ meanwhile is parallel
				and partially linked to the ‘Israeli-Palestinian conflict’. This
				phenomenon is characterized by the problematics of the mentioned
				Palestinian refugees, the exacerbation of the Palestinian national
				desire for a state-building – initiated in the 1920s – as well as the
				emergence of groups of Palestinian activists in the late 1960s carrying
				out bombings, hostage-taking and hijackings. The present work gives the
				reader a comprehensive insight into the aforementioned subjects.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-3">
				One of the unresolved issues related to Jewish-Arab conflicts in history
				and present is the ‘status of Jerusalem’, which both sides Israelis and
				Palestinians claim as their capital. During all these conflicts starting
				already after World War I, Jerusalem has always been in the eye of the
				storm. For many people involved on both sides – and certainly also for
				some observers – the Middle East conflict has a strong religious
				component as ‎Jerusalem is a holy city for Jews, Christians, and
				Muslims. For the very same reason, numerous Jews do not want to give up
				the Temple Mount, on which the Temple stood until 70 CE, and its western
				outer wall – the so-called Wailing Wall – which today is the most
				important shrine of Judaism. For the Jews, there is ample historical
				evidence for this claim. They connect the promises of the Torah and the
				‎waiting for the Messiah with the return to the Holy Land and the
				conquest of Jerusalem in 1967-War. Based on the same ideology the
				settlement of holy sites such as Hebron in the West Bank would not have
				been possible to this extent without ‎religious motivation.‎
			</p>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Equally the Dome of the Rock, located in East Jerusalem, represents a
				special sanctuary for Muslims. This glorification, as we will learn from
				reading this book, obviously does not have any historical archaic roots
				in Islamic scriptures. The veneration of Jerusalem is rather a
				consequence of events in the 20th century. For ‎radical Muslims,
				however, the very existence of Israel in Jerusalem is a ‘problem’,
				because an area that once belonged to the ‎sphere of Islamic influence
				cannot be left to ‘infidels’.‎ The most important concern of the Muslim
				Palestinians is therefore Jerusalem as the capital of a separate state
				with the Temple Mount as its center. Part of this idea is based on the
				early Umayyad Caliphate tradition and according to the story narrated in
				Sura 17, verses 1-2 of the Quran. The account refers to the meeting of
				prophet Muhammad with Allah accompanied by the archangel Gabriel and
				prophet's ascension to heaven. This miracle – so the narrative –
				occurred at the location of today's Dome of the Rock. The author has
				dealt in detail with this almost ‎mythological event and its subsequent
				exegetic interpretations by some prominent Muslim scholars.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Since there is not even agreement on the applicable decisive criteria on
				both sides, ‎respectively because each side postulates the principles
				most useful to them in the argument as authoritative, the long-lasting
				and tenacious conflict is inevitable. This crisis is fueled even further
				by ‎continuously creating new facts on the ground. The establishment of
				new Israeli settlements in the West Bank is often cited as an example.
				On the other hand, fears are expressed on the Israeli side that the
				overall significantly higher natality among Arabs would change the
				existing demographic situation in the long term and lead to an Arab
				preponderance. However, this is often contrasted with the equally high
				birth rate in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. These and ‎other
				arguments make it difficult to reach a consensus on the establishment of
				two equal ‎states side by side.‎

				Even if the author of this book is not a historian by training, he
				offers the non-specialist reader a broad knowledge, particularly from
				the inside, about the Jewish-Arab conflicts and this is supported by the
				application of a comprehensible diction with numerous facts. The author
				accompanies and helps the reader to better grasp the background of the
				conflicts and the basis of the disputes between Israelis and Arabs
				respectively the Jews and the Muslims and to understand the historical
				background of this mutual resentment. Last but not least, the writer
				does not leave the reader with mere historical facts and data, in
				Chapter V he pleads for a possible peace or at least a peace solution
				based on the already existing common grounds, mutual understanding, and
				consolidative respect.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-3">
				In many aspects, such an optimistic viewpoint is not farfetched from
				reality as some of the recent political initiatives and international
				treaties in and with the Muslim world and the Middle East, in
				particular, would leave certainly some space to ponder on such a
				peaceful solution. In this manner, Egypt and Jordan were the first Arab
				countries which signed a peace treaty with Israel, in 1979 respectively
				in 1993. Furthermore, the Abraham Accords, signed on September 15, 2020,
				were two peace treaties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates on
				the one hand and between Israel and Bahrain on the other. Another event
				happened on October 23, 2020, as former US President Donald Trump
				announced that Israel and Sudan would normalize their relations.
				Subsequently, an agreement was signed on January 6, 2021, in Khartoum.
				On December 10, 2020, Israel and Morocco agreed to normalize their
				relations under an agreement negotiated with the help of the United
				States. Hence a joint declaration was signed on December 22, 2020, in
				Rabat. And finally, On January 30, 2022, Israeli President Isaac Herzog
				began the first-ever official visit to the UAE at the invitation of
				Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Thus, for the first
				time in the history of the Modern Middle East, the national anthem of
				Israel Hatikvah (Hebrew: ‘hope’) has been orchestrated in the prince’s
				palace in Abu Dhabi.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Even though in none of the aforementioned promising agreements with the
				state of Israel Palestinian authorities had any share or contribution,
				nevertheless the recent events show that the Muslim world can and should
				not be characterized as a unified body with a monotonic strategy towards
				Israel and the Jews. The aforementioned initiatives would undoubtedly
				make a difference and probably could be also imperative for other Muslim
				populations including Palestinians.
